# Metronome-V2
AI Drumming Coach for those looking to self teach, and because I'm a drummer

### Why?
One of the hardest parts about drumming alone is that there's really nobody around who can criticize the mistakes you make during playing, this project hopes to help you out

### Features
Some of the things that this project will help you work on include:
- Beat timing
- Accuracy
- Posture
But it will not instantly make you a professional, you do that by practicing

### Tech Stack
**Frontend**  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React + TailwindCSS  
- getUserMedia() API (for webcam/audio capture)

**Backend**  
- FastAPI (for API and WebSocket handling)  
- MediaPipe (real-time pose estimation)  
- mido + python-rtmidi (MIDI input parsing)

**Machine Learning / Analysis**  
- scikit-learn (baseline timing models)  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (deep learning for pose & beat classification)  
- Jupyter Notebooks (model development)

**Data & Visualization**  
- numpy, pandas (data handling)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (visual feedback)

### Status
- Project in early development (started July 1-2, 2025)
- July 2nd 2025: Currently finalizing data sources and initial system design
- July 3rd-10th: Started work on the Backend
- July 13th: Started work on the Fronted
- July 20th: Frontend alpha done, won't commit just yet needs a lot of tweaking, also successfuly connected Frontend to Backend

### Next Steps
- Begin collecting drum audio and MIDI data
- Start feature extraction and baseline model testing




### Changelog
- 2025-07-02: Project officially initialized and planning stage is done, also added this README to it
- 2025-7-13: Started work on the Frontend and how to connect it to the Backend (No ML stuff yet!)
